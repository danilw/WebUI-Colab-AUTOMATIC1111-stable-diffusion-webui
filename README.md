# DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE

reason - [**Colab PM message**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12t8tc7/comment/jh2rwe1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

> Colab PM here.

> Sorry. We prioritize interactive notebook compute for free of charge tier users - the webui is just using Colab as a convenient free GPU. We try to be cool, but usage has really been increasing lately and it's very noticeable now in our costs. I am constrained with what we can do with our budget!

> So we started warning on our free tier as a first step.
